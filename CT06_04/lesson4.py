## Task 4: Variable Reassignment Basics

#Assign the string "Hello" to a variable 'message'. 
#Then reassign 'message' to the integer "10" and print it.

#message = "Hello"
#message = 10
#print(message)

#---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 5: Printing Full Name

#Create 2 variables, 'firstName' and 'lastName', assigning your
#first and last names to them. Then print them on the same line
#with a space between them.

#firstName = "Elijah"
#lastName = "Chua"
#print(firstName, lastName)

#---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 6: Age and Name Concatenation

#Assign a name to the variable "user_name"
#Assign an integer to the variable "user_age"
#Use type conversion and string concatenation to print out
#"[user_name] is [user_age] years old."

user_name = "Elijah"
user_age = "12"
print(user_name + " is " + user_age +  " years old")
